# <Professional Readme Generator>

## Description

This is a simple command-line app that generates a markdown file with the professional README structure needed to build quality projects.

The lack of time to create a professional README file was the main motivator to create this app. Developers spend too much time writing code and debugging, so it is expected that creating and formating a README file takes precious time.

### User story

## Installation

This app will need the user to install node.js.

## Usage

When started, the user will see questions in the command line and will be able to answer them.
Once all the questions are answered, the file is generated.
The user can edit, copy, or manipulate the file in any way they see fit.

Example of use can be seen at [Command line markdown generator](https://youtu.be/c0fn7qQBOBA).
