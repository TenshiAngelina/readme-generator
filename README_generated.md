## Description

  This is an app made with node.js and inquirer.
  - I was motivated by the very little time I have to create README files.
  - I built it to help me out with the generation of README files.
  - It solves the problem of lack of time to generate professional markdown files.
  - Through this project I learned how to use node.js and apply this knowledge into a real applciation.
